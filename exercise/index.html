    <p>SASS is Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets. It's CSS with all the extra syntax that you may have always longed for.</p>

    <p>CSS is the language we use to apply styles to HTML pages. It's a lovely, simple little language which allows us to select parts of the DOM, and apply style rules to those parts. It is now quite old, and perhaps lacking in a few features. The simplified syntax, so liberating when decorating a small DOM, becomes limiting at scale.</p>

    <p>SASS attempts to address these limitations.</p>
